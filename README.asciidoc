# UDPEchoClient - A Multi-Threaded UDP Echo Client Tool

*UDPEchoClient* is a command-line tool that generates a stream of UDP packets and times
their round-trip time through a UDP echo server.  It is useful evaluating network performance
as well as testing the behavior of network drivers.

*UDPEchoClient* uses a multi-threaded, multi-socket design with a configurable number of send/receive
thread pairs sending and receiving packets over a single socket.  All packets are sent to a single IPv4
or IPv6 address, and a single UDP port at address (although see Send-to-Self Mode below).

Counts of packets sent and received, along with packet round-trip times, are collected and summarized on
periodic basis while the tool runs.

The tool can be configured to run for a specified period of time (default: 10 seconds), or until a
certain number of packets have been sent.  After sending completes, tool continues to run for a configurable
"wind-down" period (default: 3 seconds) to give time for all responses to be received.

The *UDPEchoClient* runs on either Linux or Windows.  Currently, building for Windows requires the MinGW-w64
tool chain, in either native or cross compilation configurations.

## Command Line Options

The *UDPEchoClient* tool is invoked as follows:

    UDPEchoClient [<option>...] <remote-host> [<remote-port>]

where `<remote-host>` is the ip address or hostname of the UDP Echo server and `<remote-port>` is the server's listening port.
If a remote port is not given, it defaults to 7 (the standard UDP Echo port).

*UDPEchoClient* accepts the following command line options:

[frame=none,grid=none]
[cols="m,3d"]
|===
|-t, --threads=_int_          | Number of send/receive thread pairs. Defaults to 1.
|-c, --send-count=_int_       | Number of packets that each sending thread sends at each send interval. Defaults to 1.
|-i, --send-interval=_int_    | Interval between sending, in microseconds.  Defaults to 1000000 (1 second).
|-T, --send-time=_int_        | Total amount of time to spend sending packets, in seconds.  Defaults to 10.
|-L, --send-limit=_int_       | Maximum number of packets to send across all threads.  Defaults to unlimited.
|-s, --packet-size=_int_      | Size of the UDP packet payload in bytes. Defaults to 20.
|-w, --wind-down=_int_        | Amount of time to continuing waiting for packets after sending completes, in seconds. Defaults to 3.
|-l, --local-port=_int_       | Base port number for local sockets. Each send/receive thread pair increments this number by 1. Defaults to 50000.
|-r, --stats-interval=_int_   | Interval at which send/receive statistics are reported.  Defaults to 1.  Specify 0 to disable periodic reporting.
|-n, --no-affinity            | Disable use of processor affinity.
|-R, --receive-buf-size=_int_ | Size of the UDP socket receive buffer, in bytes.  Defaults to system default.
|-S, --send-buf-size=_int_    | Size of the UDP socket send buffer, in bytes.  Defaults to system default.
|-h, --help                   | Display the help message.

## Send-to-Self Mode

If a dash (`-`) is given as the name of the remote host, the *UDPEchoClient* tool will operate in _send-to-self_ mode.
In this mode, each sending thread sends directly to its own UDP port, resulting in all communcation looping back through
the local kernel.  This mode is useful for testing the basic functionality of the tool, as well as evaluating the innate capacity of the underlying operating system.
